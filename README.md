# valence-extra

This library implements some minecraft vanilla-like features for [valence](https://github.com/valence-rs/valence). They are designed to be as modular and configurable as possible,
so they can be easily used to create mini-game servers.

This repository aims to implement features as close to vanilla as possible (with extra configuration).
